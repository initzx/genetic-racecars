Game achieved with the help of natural selection and Python, highly advanced vector arithmetic was also used.
 
The game can be ran by cloning the repository and running `main.exe`. `main.exe` must be ran in the same directory as tracks folder, `config-feedforward` must also be present. 
The game can also be ran with Python 3.8 by running main.py, but make sure to install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` first. 

### Modifying the game
The game was made using Python 3.8.
If you wish to modify the game, then clone the repository into a project and install the required dependencies that are listed in `requirements.txt`

If you are familiar with the NEAT-Python library, you could try modifying the parameters specified in `config-feedforward` to your own liking.
